# Improved the CSharp class
# Operators are now reflected language independent
# Renamed NRType to NRTypeUsage to make the reason of the class more clearly
! The interfaces another interface derives from where not reflected
! Only interfaces which are not part of the base class / interface are shown as implemented interfaces
! Type parameters of nested generics where handled wrong
! Some attributes like the DynamicAttribute should not be reflected
! String and char literals where not escaped and not surrounded by "/' by NRCode.CSharp
- Nested types are no longer part of the types since they can be found by the RelationshipCreator
